# Brewology-PSP-Homebrew-Scraper


### Usage Example
Run the script in the directory you want the homebrew to be saved
```python
python3 main.py
```
When run, it will create a subfolder in which it will download all the homebrew it can grab.<br/>
It also includes cute loading bars to ease the pain of having to wait 20 hours
